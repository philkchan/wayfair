# Hello Wayfair!

Thanks for taking a look at my submission. The original instructions specified that each step should be in its own zip. Since I'm delivering the solution to you in git, I considered organizing each step into a commit history, but decided to make it slightly easier to navigate and went with a step1., step2., step3. naming convention. 

## Running tests
To run tests on each step, please issue the command

```
python3 stepX_shopping_cart.test.py
```

where X is the step #.
